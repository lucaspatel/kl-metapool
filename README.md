# kl-metapool

A collection of Jupyter notebooks and modules to support the wet lab shotgun pipeline.

## Installation

**Note that this package is designed to be used with Qiita, and some tests will 
fail without a Qiita installation.**

To install this package, first clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/biocore/kl-metapool.git
```

Create a Python3 Conda environment in which to run the package:

```bash
conda create --yes -n metapool -c bioconda 'python==3.9' scikit-learn pandas numpy nose pep8 flake8 matplotlib jupyter notebook 'seaborn>=0.7.1' pip openpyxl 'seqtk>=1.4'
```

Activate the Conda environment:

```bash
source activate metapool
```

Change directory to the downloaded repository folder and install:

```bash
cd kl-metapool
pip install -e '.[all]'
```

For users of notebook version 7.0.0 or higher, table of contents is already
installed and can be activated from the pull-down menus. Notebook 6.5.5 users
or lower will need to perform the following two additional steps to install
and activate table of contents:

First, install the nbextension plugin:
```bash
jupyter contrib nbextension install --sys-prefix --skip-running-check
```

Second, install the table of contents (TOC) extension
```bash
jupyter nbextension enable toc2/main
```

## Test

To run all tests, including those that depend on Qiita, type:

```bash
cd kl-metapool
nosetests
```

## Use

The notebooks themselves contain detailed usage instructions. 

Ideally, when using a notebook, you will copy the original and 
use it for each plate you create with the shotgun pipeline.

Just make sure to activate the right Conda environment before starting the
notebook.

Here's a quick example:

```bash
cp metagenomics_pooling.ipynb ~/New_project/new_project_pooling.ipynb
cd ~/New_project
source activate metapool
jupyter notebook
```
